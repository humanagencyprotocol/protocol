As AI becomes capable of writing and shipping code autonomously, we need guardrails that keep humans in the loop — not as a formality, but as genuine decision-makers. This demo shows how: a checkpoint that forces reviewers to engage with changes before signing a cryptographic attestation. The attestation proves not just that someone clicked approve, but that they confirmed understanding of the problem, objective, and tradeoffs.

The full protocol goes further: domain-specific gates tailored to context, verified identity, integration with deployment systems and AI-assisted review that helps humans understand complex changes — not bypass them. The goal is twofold: prevent gradual loss of direction as systems scale, and provide clear, attributable authorization in high-risk or regulated environments where decisions must be explicit and defensible.

## How It Works

This demo implements a **human checkpoint for code deployment**. Before any PR can be merged, a human must review the changes and create a cryptographic attestation proving they made an informed decision.

### Navigation

The UI features a persistent navigation bar showing:
- **AI Assistant** link (left) - Configure optional AI assistance
- **6 Gate pills** - Visual progress through the attestation flow

Gates can be revisited and edited after completion. Changes are held in draft state until explicitly saved.

### What Gets Verified

The GitHub Action checks:
- ✓ Attestation exists for the current commit SHA
- ✓ Cryptographic signature is valid
- ✓ Attestation hasn't expired
- ✓ All required roles have attested (Engineering for Canary, Engineering + Release Management for Full)

## AI Assistant (Advisory Boundary)

This demo includes an optional AI assistant to help reviewers understand changes before approving. The AI can answer questions, summarize diffs, and surface potential issues — but it has no authority in the decision process.

AI configuration is available from the **AI Assistant** link in the navigation bar. You can change settings at any time during the review.

### AI Options

1. **Local/Private AI (Recommended)** — Run AI locally with Ollama. Your data never leaves your machine. This is the trusted option.

2. **Public AI (Demo only)** — Use OpenAI, Groq, or other cloud providers. **Warning:** Do not use with sensitive or confidential data. PR content will be sent to external servers.

3. **No AI** — Review changes without AI assistance.

### What AI Can Do

- Answer questions about the changes
- Summarize diffs and highlight affected areas
- Point out potential risks or contradictions
- Help reviewers think through tradeoffs

### What AI Cannot Do

- Write or modify decision fields
- Select tradeoffs or execution paths
- Close gates or trigger attestations
- Influence what gets executed

### The Boundary

All AI output remains local and is never included in the signed attestation. The system records **what was approved** — not the AI's reasoning or the reviewer's intent.

> **Approval is always a human act, based on explicit structural commitments.**

## Quick Start

### Option A: Use the Public Server (Recommended)

A public Service Provider is available at **https://service.humanagencyprotocol.org** — no server setup required.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build shared package
pnpm --filter @hap-demo/core build

# Start UI only
pnpm dev:ui
```

Create `apps/ui/.env.local`:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<your personal access token with repo scope>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SP_URL=https://service.humanagencyprotocol.org
```

### Option B: Run Your Own Server

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build shared package
pnpm --filter @hap-demo/core build

# Start server (SP)
pnpm dev:server

# Start UI (separate terminal)
pnpm dev:ui
```

Create `apps/ui/.env.local`:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<your personal access token with repo scope>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SP_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## GitHub Setup

### Enable Branch Protection (Required for Merge Gate)

To block merges without valid attestations, you need to set up a branch ruleset:

1. Go to **Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New ruleset → New branch ruleset**
2. Configure the ruleset:
   - **Ruleset name:** `HAP Protection`
   - **Enforcement status:** `Active`
3. Under **Target branches**, click **Add target** → **Include by pattern**:
   - Enter: `main`
4. Under **Branch rules**, enable:
   - **Require status checks to pass**
     - Click **Add checks** and search for: `Verify HAP Attestation`
   - **Require a pull request before merging** (recommended)
   - **Block force pushes** (recommended)
5. Click **Create**

Without this setup, the workflow will report status but won't block merges.

> **Note:** The GitHub Action automatically uses `https://service.humanagencyprotocol.org` for attestation verification. No additional configuration is needed.

## Demo Flow

### Single Approval (Canary Path)

1. Create a PR to the `main` branch
2. Run `pnpm dev:ui` (or also `pnpm dev:server` if running locally)
3. Open http://localhost:3000
4. Configure AI Assistant (optional) or click Continue to skip
5. **Gate 1 - Frame:** Enter the PR URL, click "Load PR", select **Canary** path, close gate
6. **Gate 2 - Decision Owner:** Select **Engineering** role, lock role and close gate
7. **Gate 3 - Problem:** Write what problem this change addresses (20-240 chars), close gate
8. **Gate 4 - Objective:** Write what outcome you're approving (20-240 chars), close gate
9. **Gate 5 - Tradeoffs:** Write what risks you accept as Engineering under Canary, close gate
10. **Gate 6 - Commitment:** Review summary and click "Sign Attestation"
11. Click "Post to PR Comment" to add the attestation to the PR
12. The GitHub Action will verify the attestation and allow merge

### Multi-Person Approval (Full Path)

For production deployments requiring multiple approvals:

1. Create a PR and in Gate 1, select **Full (immediate deployment)** path
2. **Engineer** goes through all 6 gates:
   - Gate 2: Select role **Engineering**
   - Gates 3-5: Articulate problem, objective, and tradeoffs
   - Gate 6: Sign and post attestation to PR
3. **Release Manager** goes through the UI separately:
   - Gate 2: Select role **Release Management**
   - Gates 3-5: Articulate from their perspective
   - Gate 6: Sign and post as another PR comment
4. GitHub Action verifies both attestations are present and valid
5. Merge is allowed only when all required roles have attested

| Execution Path | Required Approvals |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Canary | Engineering only |
| Full | Engineering + Release Management |

## Endpoints

## Environment Variables

### Server

## Protocol Compliance

This demo implements:

- **Deploy Gate Profile v0.2** - Frame canonicalization, Decision Owner scopes
- **Attestation format** - Ed25519 signatures, TTL enforcement
- **Multi-person approval** - Role-based attestations aggregated by workflow
- **Cryptographic verification** - Signature verification via deployed service
- **Error codes** - INVALID_SIGNATURE, EXPIRED, FRAME_MISMATCH, etc.
