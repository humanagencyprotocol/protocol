As AI becomes capable of writing and shipping code autonomously, we need guardrails that keep humans in the loop — not as a formality, but as genuine decision-makers. This demo shows how: a checkpoint that forces reviewers to engage with changes before signing a cryptographic attestation. The attestation proves not just that someone clicked approve, but that they confirmed understanding of the problem, objective, and tradeoffs.

The full protocol goes further: domain-specific gates tailored to context, verified identity, integration with deployment systems and AI-assisted review that helps humans understand complex changes — not bypass them. The goal is twofold: prevent gradual loss of direction as systems scale, and provide clear, attributable authorization in high-risk or regulated environments where decisions must be explicit and defensible. 

## How It Works

This demo implements a **human checkpoint for code deployment**. Before any PR can be merged, a human must review the changes and create a cryptographic attestation proving they made an informed decision.

### The Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. DEVELOPER creates PR                                                │
│     └─→ GitHub Action runs → ❌ Blocks merge (no attestation)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                    ↓

│     • Reviews actual code changes                                       │
│     • Confirms understanding via checkboxes:                            │

│       ☑ I accept the tradeoffs                                         │
│     • Selects their role (Engineering / Release Management)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  3. SERVICE PROVIDER signs attestation                                  │

│     • Records which gates were passed                                   │
│     • Signs with Ed25519 key                                            │
│     • Returns cryptographic blob with 1-hour TTL                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  4. REVIEWER posts attestation as PR comment                            │
│     └─→ GitHub Action re-runs → Verifies signature → ✅ Allows merge   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What Gets Verified

The GitHub Action checks:
- ✓ Attestation exists for the current commit SHA
- ✓ Cryptographic signature is valid
- ✓ Attestation hasn't expired
- ✓ All required roles have attested (Engineering for Canary, Engineering + Release Management for Full)

## Trusted AI Assistant (Advisory Boundary)

This demo includes a trusted AI assistant to help reviewers understand changes before approving. The AI can answer questions, summarize diffs, and surface potential issues — but it has no authority in the decision process.

### What AI Can Do

- Answer questions about the changes
- Summarize diffs and highlight affected areas
- Point out potential risks or contradictions
- Help reviewers think through tradeoffs

### What AI Cannot Do

- Write or modify decision fields
- Select tradeoffs or execution paths
- Close gates or trigger attestations
- Influence what gets executed

### The Boundary

All AI output remains local and is never included in the signed attestation. The system records **what was approved** — not the AI's reasoning or the reviewer's intent.

> **Approval is always a human act, based on explicit structural commitments.**

AI configuration is optional and can be set at the start of the review process. You can use a trusted provider, configure your own endpoint, or disable AI entirely.

```

## Quick Start

### Option A: Use the Public Server (Recommended)

A public Service Provider is available at **https://service.humanagencyprotocol.org** — no server setup required.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build shared package
pnpm --filter @hap-demo/core build

# Start UI only
pnpm dev:ui
```

Create `apps/ui/.env.local`:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<your personal access token with repo scope>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SP_URL=https://service.humanagencyprotocol.org
```

### Option B: Run Your Own Server

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build shared package
pnpm --filter @hap-demo/core build

# Start server (SP)
pnpm dev:server

# Start UI (separate terminal)
pnpm dev:ui
```

Create `apps/ui/.env.local`:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<your personal access token with repo scope>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SP_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## GitHub Setup

### Enable Branch Protection (Required for Merge Gate)

To block merges without valid attestations, you need to set up a branch ruleset:

1. Go to **Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New ruleset → New branch ruleset**
2. Configure the ruleset:
   - **Ruleset name:** `HAP Protection`
   - **Enforcement status:** `Active`
3. Under **Target branches**, click **Add target** → **Include by pattern**:
   - Enter: `main`
4. Under **Branch rules**, enable:
   - **Require status checks to pass**
     - Click **Add checks** and search for: `Verify HAP Attestation`
   - **Require a pull request before merging** (recommended)
   - **Block force pushes** (recommended)
5. Click **Create**

Without this setup, the workflow will report status but won't block merges.

> **Note:** The GitHub Action automatically uses `https://service.humanagencyprotocol.org` for attestation verification. No additional configuration is needed.

## Demo Flow

### Single Approval (Canary Path)

1. Create a PR to the `main` branch
2. Run `pnpm dev:server` and `pnpm dev:ui`
3. Open http://localhost:3000
4. Enter the PR URL and click "Load PR"
5. Select **Canary (gradual rollout)** execution path
6. Review changes and check the confirmation boxes
7. Select **Engineering** role
8. Click "Request Attestation"
9. Click "Post Attestation to PR" to add it as a PR comment
10. The GitHub Action will verify the attestation and allow merge

### Multi-Person Approval (Full Path)

For production deployments requiring multiple approvals:

1. Create a PR and select **Full (immediate deployment)** path
2. **Engineer** goes through the UI:
   - Select role: **Engineering**
   - Complete attestation and post to PR
3. **Release Manager** goes through the UI separately:
   - Select role: **Release Management**
   - Complete attestation and post as another PR comment
4. GitHub Action verifies both attestations are present and valid
5. Merge is allowed only when all required roles have attested

| Execution Path | Required Approvals |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Canary | Engineering only |
| Full | Engineering + Release Management |

## Endpoints

### Service Provider (SP)

- `GET /api/sp/pubkey` - Get SP public key
- `POST /api/sp/attest` - Request attestation
- `POST /api/sp/verify` - Verify attestation signature

### Attestation UI

- `GET /` - Attestation wizard
- `POST /api/attest` - Request attestation (proxies to SP)
- `POST /api/comment` - Post attestation to PR
- `GET /api/comments` - Fetch PR comments

## Environment Variables

### Server

```
SP_PRIVATE_KEY=<hex>     # Ed25519 private key (optional, generates ephemeral if not set)
SP_PUBLIC_KEY=<hex>      # Ed25519 public key
```

### UI

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<token>     # For posting/reading PR comments
NEXT_PUBLIC_SP_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Protocol Compliance

This demo implements:

- **Deploy Gate Profile v0.2** - Frame canonicalization, Decision Owner scopes
- **Attestation format** - Ed25519 signatures, TTL enforcement
- **Multi-person approval** - Role-based attestations aggregated by workflow
- **Cryptographic verification** - Signature verification via deployed service
- **Error codes** - INVALID_SIGNATURE, EXPIRED, FRAME_MISMATCH, etc.
